Explanation of Code:
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset:

The pd.read_csv() function loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
The head() function shows the first few rows of the dataset to inspect the data.
We then explore the data types and check for any missing values with isnull().sum().
The dataset is cleaned by filling missing values with the mean (or alternatively dropping rows with missing values).
Task 2: Basic Data Analysis:

The describe() function is used to compute basic statistics of numerical columns like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
The groupby() function is used to group the data by the species column and compute the mean of numerical columns for each species.
Task 3: Data Visualization:

A Line Chart is plotted showing trends over time (simulated in this example).
A Bar Chart compares the average sepal length for each species.
A Histogram visualizes the distribution of sepal lengths.
A Scatter Plot shows the relationship between sepal length and petal length with species differentiated by color.
